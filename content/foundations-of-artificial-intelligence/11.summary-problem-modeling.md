The state can be differentiated based on the the degree of the structure:

- **Atomic**: The state is denoted by an id and can be equal or different to other states.
- **Factored**: The state is denoted by a set of variables and the state is a combination of the values of the variables.
- **Structured**: The state is denoted by a set of objects and the state is a combination of the properties and relationship of the objects.

The best approach to solve a problem is based on the solution:

- If the solution require a sequence of actions, the best approach is to use a **Planning** or **Classical Search** algorithm.
- If the solution require finding a final state, but the final state can have different cost we should use **Optimization** (local search) algorithm.
- If the solution require finding a final state but all the state are equally good we should use a **Constrain Satisfaction** algorithm.
